    "description": "I'm an 18 year old, self-taught developer from India. I began fiddling with Arduinos when I was 14-ish and I was hooked. Then I learnt Python and dabbled with some computer vision and NLP projects. Most recently, I learnt Flutter. I love dogs, wave-boarding, playing chess, reading books, writing articles and keeping up to date on computer hardware.",
